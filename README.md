\# Bluff Body Flame Stabilization CFD Study



This project investigates flame stabilization mechanisms in a bluff-body combustor using ANSYS Fluent.



Objectives:

\- Evaluate recirculation residence time vs chemical timescale

\- Minimize total pressure loss

\- Quantify entropy production due to separation and heat release
